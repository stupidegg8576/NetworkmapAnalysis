#Device list data is like:
#ID   MAC   Vendor_Class  Host_name
#int  str   str           str


apple: #tag name, (Case sensitive)
  con1: #conditions: 'con' + 12345....whatever
        #each subcondition in con1 will be AND together

    with: [apple,ipad,iphone]  
      #if any target string is in Vendor_Class or Host_name
      #pass if contain 'apple', 'ipad' or 'iphone'
    without: [ms, microsoft]   
      #if any target string is NOT in Vendor_Class and Host_name
      #pass if 'ms' or 'microsoft' is not in Vendor_Class and Host_name
    exactlywith: [apple]  
      #if any target string is exactly in Vendor_Class or Host_name
      #exactly in means no other letter infront or behind target string
      #like 'my apple' will pass, 'mymanYappleS' will fail
      #TO DO:may cause something bad when Target strings too short

    mac: [XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX,00:11:22:33:XX:XX]
      #compare mac addr, X mean whatever
      #success if any MAC addr were matched
      #TO DO: support mac addr in range
      #00:11:22:33:XX:XX ~ 00:11:22:44:XX:XX

    hastag: [iphone]
      #has any target tag
      #only search previous tag, so tag order will affect
    notag: [MS]
      #doesn't have all target tag
      #only search previous tag, so tag order will affect

  con2: #conditions will be OR with each others
        #so if one device satisfied any of one conditions will get that tag

        #can have same subcondition but with diffrent name
        #like:
    with_1: [my]
    with_2: [iphone]
        #their name need to start with 'with' or 'without' or other
        #their result will be AND together
        #so it has to have both 'my' and 'iphone' in name to pass
